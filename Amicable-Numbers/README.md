# Amicable Numbers
Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.

The HP-35s program holds 2 labels:
- A, the "main" label;
- D, the function that calculates the sum of the divisors of the number inside the register V, and returns the result in the stack.
